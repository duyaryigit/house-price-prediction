### Business Problem

It is your job to predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, you must predict the value of the SalePrice variable. 

#### It is desired to develop a machine learning model that can predict the final price of each home. Before developing the model, the necessary data analysis and feature engineering steps must be performed. 
#### Submissions are evaluated on Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price. (Taking logs means that errors in predicting expensive houses and cheap houses will affect the result equally.)
